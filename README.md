VirtualThermostat
=======

VirtualThermostat is a component I created in my thesis project. It uses [SeekArc](https://github.com/neild001/SeekArc) as a base and adds further functionalities to create a thermostat.

* Shows temperature
* Shows target temperature
* Changes the color of the bar from blue to red when swipping
* Allows the user to specify the minimum and maximum target temperature values
* Shows an icon when the target temperature is in a certain range (like nest thermostat, shows the leaf)
* Change the background color programmatically
* Has all the features of [SeekArc](https://github.com/neild001/SeekArc) V1.1
